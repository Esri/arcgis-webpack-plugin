Helper plugin for building ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript applications with webpack to copy assets locally.

**This version of the plugin is for 4.18 or greater of the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/).**

For version 4.17 and lower, please see [this documentation here](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin/blob/96c60c8d469e4976d1b62ec30b4c9838e4d74480/README.md).

# Features

Requires version `4.18.0` or greater of [`arcgis-js-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arcgis-js-api) or [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core).

This plugin is only really useful if you want to copy the `@arcgis/core/assets` locally to your build. If you do not have that requirement, you may not need this plugin. It is also useful to and minimize the build output using the [additional features](#additional-features) capability of the plugin.


# Options

| Options     |     Default     | Description   |
| ----------- | :-------------: |:-------------|
| `copyAssets` | `true`  | Should plugin copy assets.  |
| `assetsDir` | `assets`  | The directory name to copy `@arcgis/core/assets` to.  |
| `locales` | `undefined`  | The `t9n` locales you want included in your build output. If not specified, all locales will be available.  |
| `features` | {} | **ADVANCED** - See the [Additional Features](#additional-features) section |
| `userDefinedExcludes` | `[]` | **ADVANCED** - You can provide an array modules as `string` that you want to exclude from the output bundles. For example, you may want to exclude layers you are not using. |

# Usage

`npm install --save-dev @arcgis/webpack-plugin`

```js
// webpack.config.js
const ArcGISPlugin = require("@arcgis/webpack-plugin");

// add it to config
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [new ArcGISPlugin()]
  ...
}
```

If you want to specify supported locales, you can define them in the plugin.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    new ArcGISPlugin({
      locales: ['en', 'es']
    })
  ]
  ...
}
```

In your application you need to set the `assetsPath` of `@arcgis/core/config`.

```js
import config from '@arcgis/core/config';

config.assetsPath = './assets';
```

## Additional Features

### Excluding modules

**NOTE - _Advanced Usage_**

If you are building a 2D mapping application and do not require 3D, you can exclude 3D related modules by disabling the 3d `features`. This option will remove 3D modules from the output JavaScript bundles for your application. Please note, _this does not impact the file size of the JavaScript used in your application, only in the number of bundles generated_.

```js
// webpack.config.js
...
plugins: [
  new ArcGISPlugin({
    // exclude 3D modules from build
    features: {
      "3d": false
    }
  })
],
...
```

You also have the option to pass in an array of other modules that you may want to exclude from your application. For example, maybe you are not using a particular set of layers. You can add them to the `userDefinedExcludes` option.

```js
// webpack.config.js
...
plugins: [
  new ArcGISPlugin({
    // exclude modules you do not need
    userDefinedExcludes: [
      "@arcgis/core/layers/BingMapsLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/CSVLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/GeoRSSLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/ImageryLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/KMLLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/MapImageLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/OpenStreetMapLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/StreamLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/WMSLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/WMTSLayer",
      "@arcgis/core/layers/WebTileLayer"
    ]
  })
],
...
```

You can specify that you do not want to copy assets, but want to exclude some modules.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    new ArcGISPlugin({
      copyAssets: false,
      // exclude 3D modules from build
      features: {
        "3d": false
      }
    })
  ]
  ...
}
```

Again, this considered **ADVANCED** usage, so please use with caution.
